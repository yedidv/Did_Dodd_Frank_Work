# Did the Dodd Frank Act Actually Work? 

   The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which forced large banks to meet the
standard minimum regulatory ratios of equity to assets under several adverse economic scenarios, was passed in
2009 after the financial crisis. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss whether the financial crisis in 2007
changed the regional and large banks in terms of volatility and asset pricing model. Volatility model and asset
pricing models would be used to test the volatility and asset pricing differences between the control group (regional
banks) and treated groups of bank holding companies (large banks). Minimal evidence was found that there were
changes to returns and volatility for these companies due to the implementation of this act (confirming previous
analysis of market analysis and economists).
